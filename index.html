            <p>Your HTML and CSS skills will come in handy to make this look great, but the focus of this project is to give you an opportunity to use JavaScript. Specifically, you will use what you have learned about DOM Manipulation!</p>

<h3 id="must-haves">Must-Haves</h3>

<ul>
  <li>User will need a place to input images.</li>
  <li>Upon the user submitting the picture the picture should appear on the DOM.</li>
  <li>The user can enter as many pictures as they like and see all the pictures appear on the screen.</li>
  <li>A visually appealing, responsive site</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You will need to research how to recieve an image as an input. You may want to look up image formats as well.</li>
  <li>Follow the iterations closely. This project brings a <em>lot</em> of your new knowledge together; the iterations help you break down this big problem into bite-sized chunks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iteration-1---wireframe--vision">Iteration 1 - Wireframe &amp; Vision</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Draw out your vision for the way your site will look - on a desktop, iPad size, and phone size.</li>
  <li>Like we did with the Photo Gallery, label each section with the HTML element that will be used.</li>
  <li>What kind of information will your “Instagram” hold? What inputs will you need?</li>
  <li>Decide on your color palette. <a href="https://colorsupplyyy.com/app">Color Supply</a> is a great resource for this!</li>
  <li>Make sure your wireframe and assets are approved by your instructor before moving on.
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iteration-2---html--css">Iteration 2 - HTML &amp; CSS</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Now that you have wireframes, write out the HTML to make this come to life.</li>
  <li>Apply styles, including media queries.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iteration-3---dom-manipulation">Iteration 3 - DOM Manipulation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Write an event listener and handler for your button/inputs.</li>
  <li>Inside the event handler, write the code necessary to generate a list.</li>
  <li>At the end of this iteration, your app should be completely functional.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iteration-4---deploy">Iteration 4 - Deploy</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Create a GitHub repository</li>
  <li>Commit and push your work</li>
  <li>Deploy to GitHub pages in the Settings tab</li>
</ul>
